Cntrl+ Z is undo => changes are reversed.

Cntrl + Y is redo => changes are restored.

today, i forgot to ccreate a new file and updated
code in same file.

git init is used to create a new repository.

a repository is storage for code like a folder or a total codebase.
the main folder from where our code starts is called as repository.
