HTML selectors, id's and classes and thier use for css.


We should not use any tags except self-closing tags in a <p> tag,i.e., paragraph tag.
The main thing to remeber are the major tags which can be used in real world projects.
in real world what happens, we do not focus on tags, we just focus on the CSS we give to the tags

hr tag => is used to draw a horizontal line on the web page.

In C we saw that there are octal, hexadecimal and binary numbers.
now in css for styling with colors, we use hexadecimal numbers.
0-9  and A-F
alphabets and numbers re used for styling.


Inline Styling is done within the tag itself.
ex:
<div style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">Hello World</div>
Internal styling is done inside the head tag of HTML.

head tag has meta-data.
using head tag we tell browser that we are using css in our code.

we shpould always focus on good practices of coding.
these are the things which are asked majorly in interviews.

To make our code readable and understand where we are using various tags for various pupposes we something called classes and id's.

first rule of using id: give a unique name which should not be used by any other tag.
if we give more than one id to a tag, it will break the first rule

in class: we can either give a unique name or a common name, but in id we definately have to give a unique name.

always remember the spelling colour which we use in programming is color.
